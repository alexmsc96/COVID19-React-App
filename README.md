_disease.sh, newsapi.org, React, React-Router, Axios, CSS, MATERIAL-UI, google-map-react react-chartjs-2_

## Description

This application consists of a COVID19 tracker app where the users are able to:

- Fetch data about COVID19 from a third-party API in real-time
- Visualize on a map data about the spread of COVID19 worlwide
- See graphs explaining the spread of the virus
- See news about COVID19.

## To run locally

1. git clone https://github.com/alexmsc96/COVID19-React-App.git
2. cd COVID19-React-App
3. npm install
4. npm run

Additionally, you need to add your own API KEY inside a .env file

### Thoughts

For my first application built with React.js, I immediately saw the advantages of using this framework.
### Goals:
For future React project:

- implement Redux
- axios instance
- better overall organization of the code
